# RNA_data_analysis_scripts
This is a collection of scripts written during my internship in Genome Institute of Singapore.

There are four projects that I worked on:
1. Feedforward neural network for predicting the reactivity of nucleotide using SHAPE data.
2. Generate secondary and tiertiary RNA structures with viennaRNA and FARFAR2 program.
3. Data analysis on RNA data (both pdb and fasta).
4. Graph Neural Network and message passing experiments.
